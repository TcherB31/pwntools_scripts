# pwntools_scripts
I have written several scripts for attacks on binary and server using the pwntools library
To get started, install the pwntools library itself, and you will also need python3+, for installation, write:

    pip install pwntools && sudo apt intall python*

After that, you can safely use ready-made scripts to perform pwn tasks
