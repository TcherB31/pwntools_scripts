# pwntools_scripts
I have written several scripts for attacks on binary and server using the pwntools library
To get started, install the pwntools library itself, and you will also need python3+, for installation, write:

    sudo apt intall python* && pip install pwntools

After that, you can safely use ready-made scripts to perform pwn tasks
